### A fake repo for my Data Science team buddies to mess around with! 


You will first have to set up Github on your computer:

[Check the Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en)



## TRY:
- cloning the repo
- creating a new branch from main
- make some changes to the docs
- commit those changes
- push it up
- create a pull request
